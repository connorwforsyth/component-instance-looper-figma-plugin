## The component instance looper enables users to generate and populate component instances with text at scale.

By accepting a string of text separated by line breaks, the plugin creates instances of the selected component.

This is suitable if you have many component instances to create or edit, and you don't want to go one-by-one editing each individually.

You can also replace text in selected instances and specify which variable you wish to replace.

This workflow reduces context switching and dramatically speeds up efficiency for designers while adding content to their components instances.
