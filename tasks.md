As a user:
- I want to drop in a simple text list, or perhaps a bulletted list in to a UI... 
- Select the component instance in question from the canvas...
- Decide on the instance property that I want to create.
- For each line break, create a new instance of that component, separating out the line from that text list into an instance of the component.

[] Create a UI in figma that takes a text field
[] Create a ui in figma thatÂ acknowledges the selected component instance and enables you to select the properies of that intance that you want to select change. resticted to property of type text.
[] Generate component instances... place them on the canvas below the created instance.
[] place them below on the y axis. place them heightt of the component + 0.3*hieght of the instance away from the other.
[] select all the new component instances.
[] snap to view in the canvas to view all the generated components.
